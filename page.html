<article> <h1>Intro</h1>
    When you think of Nikola Tesla, the first thing that comes to mind 
    is likely his groundbreaking work in the field of electricity. But 
    did you know that Tesla was also fascinated with the Great Pyramids 
    of Giza and believed that they held a secret to unlocking free energy? 
    In this article, we’ll explore Tesla’s research on pyramids and 
    separate fact from fiction.
  <h2> <p>1. Mystery of The Pyramids </p> </h2>
  For centuries, the pyramids have fascinated scholars, scientists, and 
  historians alike. How did the ancient Egyptians build such impressive 
  structures without modern technology? And what was their purpose?
  Tesla believed that the pyramids were more than just tombs for 
  the pharaohs. He believed that they were energy generators, capable 
  of producing free, limitless energy. His theory was based on the fact 
  that the pyramids were made of conductive materials, such as granite 
  and limestone, which could transmit energy.
