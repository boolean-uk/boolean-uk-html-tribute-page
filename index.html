    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>The Azores is an autonomous region of Portugal, cast adrift in the North Atlantic and warmed by the surging Gulf
      Stream. The dramatic topography owes its existence to millennia of volcanic bursts and mighty underwater trembles
      carving, compressing and forcing the peaks of ocean-floor mountains up for breath. Once exposed, moss, cedar forests,
      hydrangea and ginger lilies take hold, carpeting the ridges and crevices—and even clothing fences, pylons and
      billboards. Often described as <cite>Hawaii of Europe</cite></p>

    <h2>The weather</h2>
    <p>I am pretty sure the weather in Azores is bipolar.
      If I had a penny for every time someones ask me a question “How will the weather be in *insert random date*?” I'd be
      disgustingly rich.</p>
    <p> The thing is: no one knows. The Azores are remotely located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean which causes the
      weather
      to be truly unstable.</p>
    <p> Any Azorean knows the weather can change dramatically at any minute. I went to school every single day with an
      umbrella in my backpack, even in the shiniest and brightest of the days. A clear blue sky in the morning and a storm
      in the afternoon is pretty common.</p>
    
    <p>This unpredictability might be a bit inconvenient, but also adds a pinch of charm and fun to it. You never know what
      you'll find which makes the whole experience more… real. </p>
    
    <h2>There are signs of volcanic activity everywhere.</h2>
    <p>The Azores are considered to be the European Hawaii and for sure the volcanic activity is a big reason behind it. Yet
      another way to see nature in its purest form.</p>
    <p> You can find some volcanic activity manifestations all around:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The dark black sand of all beaches in Azores.</li>
      <li>The geysers in Furnas Valley where hot steam literally comes from deep under the ground. You can actually taste
        food cooked underground.</li>
      <li>The Capelinhos volcano in Faial where you can literally walk on the apocalyptic lava remains of a recent eruption
        (the closest you'll have to walking on the moon!).</li>
      <li>thermal springs where you can enjoy the heat of Mother Earth on a “human soup” experience.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>The best lakes in Azores islands</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Lagoa do Fogo</li>
      <li>Lagoa das Sete Cidades</li>
      <li>Lagoa das Furnas</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Mother Nature is in charge</h2>
    <p>This is the most important thing. Being back in touch with nature is one of
      the strong selling points of a trip to the islands.
      What is not immediately visible is why the Azores have managed to keep their stunning lakes, cliffs, meadows as
      beautiful for so long. And it all comes down to respect by Mother Nature. She's in charge.
      Locals have a deep respect for nature and for the ocean in particular. Sustainability and eco-friendly are big words
      in the islands!
