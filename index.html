        <h2><em>THE EXERCISE</em></h2>
        <p>Snowboarding offers a load of cardio and muscle training. The repeated impacting and cushioning you do forces
          your legs and core into a nearly constant active state. This strengthens and powers you up the more you do it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2><em>THE FREEDOM</em></h2>
        <p>The surf like action of snowboarding is a super liberating one. When you lean from edge to edge and gain a
          nice carve you feel like a elegant dancer slashing up the piste. That extends all over the mountain to
          whatever terrain you are riding</p>
        <br>
        <h2><em>THE SNOW</em></h2>
        <p>The snow is an absolute beast. From hardpack runs to tree compressed glades to sweet sweet powder. Conquering
          all types of snow is a treat. Especially when its pow. Powder is awesome.</p>
        <br>
        <h2><em>THE OUTDOORS</em></h2>
        <p>Ultimately its the enjoyment of being in the great outdoors. Moving around fast and precise on an entire
          mountain really puts things in perspectice. You get a scale for the grandness of life and the world. There you
          are, tiny and barely visible on the side of a monolith of a mountain just finding your own peace.</p>
