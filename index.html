        Miyamoto Musashi (宮本 武蔵, c. 1584 – 13 June 1645),[1] also known as
        Shinmen Takezō, Miyamoto Bennosuke or, by his Buddhist name, Niten
        Dōraku,[2] was a Japanese swordsman, philosopher, strategist, writer and
        rōnin, who became renowned through stories of his unique double-bladed
        swordsmanship and undefeated record in his 61 duels (next is 33 by Itō
        Ittōsai). Musashi, as he was often simply known, is considered a Kensei,
        a sword-saint of Japan.[3] He was the founder of the Niten Ichi-ryū, or
        Nito Ichi-ryū, style of swordsmanship, and in his final years authored
        The Book of Five Rings (五輪の書, Go Rin No Sho) and Dokkōdō (獨行道,
        The Path of Aloneness).
