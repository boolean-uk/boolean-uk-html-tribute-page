<h2> Facts about the Tiger</h2>
  <p>Tigers can live in a range of environments, including the Siberian taiga, swamps, grasslands, and rainforests. They can be found anywhere from the Russian Far East to parts of North Korea, China, India, and Southwest Asia to the Indonesian island of Sumatra.</p>
  <p>Most classifications separate the tiger species into six subspecies. These include the Siberian tiger, the Bengal tiger, the Sumatran tiger, the Indo-Chinese tiger, the South China tiger, and the Malayan tiger. Some classifications merge these subspecies, and others suggest that two distinct tiger species exist.</p>
  <p>The worldâ€™s tiger population has declined to about 3,200 tigers since the beginning of the 21st century. A century earlier, the same population was estimated at 100,000. The Indian, or Bengal, tiger makes up about half the total tiger population.</p>
