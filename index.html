    <h2>What Is Kambo?</h2>

    <p> Kambo is a secretion from the giant monkey frog, or Phyllomedusa bicolor. The secretion is lightly scrapped off the back of the frog without harming, and it is allowed to return to the forest. The bright green giant monkey frogs that live in the Amazon secrete a poisonous waxy substance to defend themselves from predators. This secretion has been used by the <a href="https://medicinefestival.com/huni-kuin/" target="_blank">indigenous people of the Amazon</a>  for thousands of years as medicine for different ailments such as: <ul>
      <li>addiction</li>
      <li>Alzheimer's disease</li>
      <li>anxiety</li>
      <li>cancer</li>
      <li>chronic pain</li>
      <li>depression</li>
      <li>hepatitis</li>
      <li>HIV and AIDS</li>
      <li>infections</li>
      <li>liver diseases</li>
      <li>rheumatism</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h2>How Does It Work</h2>

    <p>The first part of the process involves drinking about a litre of water or cassava soup.

    Next, a practitioner will use a burning stick to create a number of small burns on the skin, resulting in blisters. The blistered skin is then scraped off, and the kambo is applied to the wounds.

    From the wound, the kambo enters the lymphatic system and bloodstream, where it is said to race around the body scanning for problems. This usually results in some immediate side effects, especially vomiting.

    Once these effects begin to fade, the person will be given water or tea to help flush out the toxins and rehydrate.</p>


    <h2>Healing Benefits of Kambo</h2>

    <p>Scientific studies of Kambo have isolated a number of biochemical components, primarily peptides, that have been found to have a variety of effects within the human body that have potential for use in medical and pharmacological interventions.


Some of the potential effects of these compounds include: <ul>
<li>
Improved mood and reduced anxiety - possibly from the interactions that lead to reductions in the main stress hormone, cortisol, within the bloodstream.</li>
<br>
<li> Pain relief - certain elements have anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce the inflammation associated with some type of pain, as well as other compounds that have some opioid-like effects, and that can also cross blood-brain barrier, causing pain blocking effects within the brain itself.</li>
<br>
<li> Anti-cancer properties - an indirect result of the action of some compounds leads to reduced blood vessel growth, which is a property used in a number of treatments that can help to restrict tumour growth in cancers with targeted delivery.</li>
<br>
<li> Treatment of addiction - helping to reset certain chemical pathways in the brain that are fouled by addiction. Some of the peptides are opioid-receptor binding, meaning that they bind to the receptors in the brain that opiates normally bind to. This could help those with opiate addiction by helping to normalise brain hormonal responses without the need for opiate ingestion.</li>
<br>
<li>Lowered blood pressure - many of the peptides have vaso-dilatory effects, meaning that they widen blood vessels. This allows more room for blood to flow and so contributes to lower blood pressure. Indeed, these are what cause some of the light-headedness and dizziness that can be felt when taking Kambo.</li>
<br>
<li>Heart protective properties - in addition, this widening of blood vessels can increase blood flow to the heart. Along with some of the other effects on smooth muscle, this has the potential to aid heart health.</li> 
<br>
<li> Anti-microbial properties - many of the compounds have effects to fight against fungal and bacterial infections. Actually, this is one of the reasons why the frog from which Kambo is harvested secretes this substance in the first place - to help protect its skin from fungal and bacterial infection, which are a particular menace to amphibians.</li>
</ul>
