      <h2 id="TIGER2">The Tiger (Panthera tigris)</h2>
        <p>Tiger is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, 
          such as deer and wild boar.</p>

      <h2 id="TIGER3">Where Tigers Live</h2>
        <p>The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758. 
          It once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west 
          to the Amur River basin in the east, and in the south from the 
          foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands. 
          Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at 
          least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated from 
          Western and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas
          of Southeast and South Asia and China. What remains of the range 
          where tigers still roam free is fragmented, stretching in spots from 
          Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the 
          Indian subcontinent, Indochina and a single 
          Indonesian island, Sumatra.Following Linnaeus's first descriptions of 
          the species, several tiger specimens were described and proposed as 
          subspecies.[11] The validity of several tiger subspecies was questioned 
          in 1999. Most putative subspecies described in the 19th and 20th centuries
          were distinguished on basis of fur length and colouration, striping 
          patterns and body size, hence characteristics that vary widely within
          populations. Morphologically, tigers from different regions vary little,
          and gene flow between populations in those regions is considered to 
          have been possible during the Pleistocene. Therefore, it was proposed
          to recognize only two tiger subspecies as valid, namely P. t. tigris 
          in mainland Asia, and P. t. 
          sondaica in the Greater Sunda Islands.</p>
      <h2 id="TIGER4">Tiger Population</h2>
        <p>The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. 
        As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to 
        number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most 
        populations living in small isolated pockets. India currently 
        hosts the largest tiger population. Major reasons for population 
        decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching.
        Tigers are also victims of humanâ€“wildlife conflict, due to 
        encroachment in countries with a high human population density.Following 
        Linnaeus's first descriptions of the species, several tiger specimens 
        were described and proposed as subspecies.[11] The validity of several

        described in the 19th and 20th centuries were distinguished on basis of 
        fur length and colouration, striping patterns and body size, hence 
        characteristics that vary widely within populations. Morphologically, 
        tigers from different regions vary little, and gene flow between 
        populations in those regions is considered to have been possible 
        during the Pleistocene. Therefore, it was proposed to recognize 
        only two tiger subspecies as valid, namely P. t. tigris in mainland 
        Asia, and P. t. sondaica in the Greater Sunda Islands.Following

      <h2 id="TIGER5">Etymology</h2>
        <p>The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's
        charismatic megafauna. It featured prominently in the ancient 
        mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range 
        and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature, 
        appearing on many flags, coats of arms and as mascots for 
        sporting teams. The tiger is the national animal of India, 
        Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea.Following Linnaeus's first 
        descriptions of the species, several tiger specimens were described 
        and proposed as subspecies.[11] The validity of several tiger subspecies
