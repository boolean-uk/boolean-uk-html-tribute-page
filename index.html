      <h2 id="about">About:</h2>
      <p>Gaius Julius Caesar (12 July 100 BC – 15 March 44 BC) was a Roman general and statesman. 
        A member of the First Triumvirate, Caesar led the Roman armies in the Gallic Wars before defeating his political rival Pompey in a civil war, 
        and subsequently became dictator from 49 BC until his assassination in 44 BC.
         He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.</p>

       <p>
          The<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Wars" target="_blank">Gallic Wars</a>were waged between 58 and 50 BC by the Roman general Julius Caesar 
          against the peoples of Gaul (present-day France, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland). 
          Gallic, Germanic, and British tribes fought to defend their homelands against an aggressive Roman campaign.

          <h2 id="death">Assassination:</h2>
          <p>Julius Caesar was assassinated by a group of senators on the Ides of March (15 March) of 44 BC 
            during a meeting of the Senate at the Curia of Pompey of the Theatre of Pompey in Rome where the senators stabbed Caesar 23 times. 
            They claimed to be acting over fears that Caesar's unprecedented concentration of power during his dictatorship was undermining the Roman Republic.
            At least 60 to 70 senators were party to the conspiracy, led by Marcus Junius Brutus, Gaius Cassius Longinus, 
            and Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus. Despite the death of Caesar, the conspirators were unable to restore the institutions of the Republic. 
            The ramifications of the assassination led to his Martyrdom, 
            the Liberators' civil war and ultimately to the Principate period of the Roman Empire.</p>
