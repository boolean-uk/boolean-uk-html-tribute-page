      <h2>Black cats are the cutest cats !</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          They are truly the most floofiest boys, although they are feared by
          many and seen as a sign of bad luck, I just think they are perfect.
        </li>
        <li>What is not to love about a walking shadow with eyes??</li>
        <li>
          Sadly I must say I do not have a black cat at this moment in time but
          soon I shall adopt one and it will be a day of great joy
        </li>
        <li>
          I do however have a tuxedo cat called Pearl and I think he'll do for
          now
