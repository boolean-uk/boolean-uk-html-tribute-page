          <h1><u>Black #3</u></h1>
          <p>Black #3 is one of the most iconic cars in NASCAR history. Dale Earnhardt drove the black #3 car for most of his career. 
            <br>The black #3 car was driven by Dale Earnhardt from 1988 to 2000. Many drivers would dread seeing the black 3 in their rear view because they knew, 
            <br>you would have to move out of the way, or Dale would move you out of his way...
            <br>The black #3 car was retired in the wake of Dale's passing at the 2001 Daytona 500 until Richard Childress, Dale's long standing team owner and friend 
            <br> it back in 2014 with Childress' Grandson Austin Dillon behind the wheel.
