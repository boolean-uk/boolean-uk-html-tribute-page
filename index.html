      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Sound Systems were established in Kingston, Jamaica in the 1950's, and they form an integral part of Jamaican culture and history. </p>
      <p>Early Sound Systems were created by Jamaicans who were moving back and forth from the USA in the 1940's and 50's. They were influenced by the R&B bands playing through PA systems at New York block parties and they made the idea their own by generating homemade rudimentary Sound Systems.</p>
      <p>
        At this time, Jamaican radio stations were modelled off of BBC radio, which refused to play certain genres of music. This prompted Jamaican DJs and Sound Systems to play the music that the people wanted. They loaded vans with generators, speakers, amplifiers and turntables and transported new music to street parties.</p>
