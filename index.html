          Dexter was born on the 7th of July 2022 together with his 6 siblings. They all varied in color from pitch black to a golden brown.
          He spent the first 2 months of his life being taken care of by his mom and his siblings until he would eventually find a loving home.
          On the 25th of august 2022 a 19 year old Gabriel would together with his family, visit Dexter and his siblings at their home in hopes of finding a companion.
          The puppies didn't seem to keen on having visitors that day, except Dexter, who climbed into Gabriels arms and slept for their entire visit.
          Therefore, on the 3rd of September that following month, Gabriel and his family came over once more, to pick up none other than Dexter himself.
