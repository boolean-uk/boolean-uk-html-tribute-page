      I'd like to introduce my baby boy.
      <br>
      His a dwarf hamster and his name is <i>Sauron</i>. Or as I like to call him.. <em>"The dark hamster."</em> <br>
      <img class="sauron-pet" src="/src/images/Sauron.JPG" alt="hamster pic" width="100">
      <br>
      Maybe you'll recognize his name from a book or movie called
      <a href="https://www.warnerbros.co.uk/movies/lord-rings-fellowship-ring" target="_blank">
        <em>Lord of the rings</em></a> .
    </p>
    <p>
      I imagine you wouldn't expect a tiny animal like a hamster be called like that but, what can I say? I'm kind of a
      nerd.

    <h3>
      Few things that about him
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hamsters are usually more active during the night time but, Sauron likes to be different from all the others of
      his
      species so, usually, he wakes up every time he thinks there's food around.
      <br>
      He doesn't care what you're eating, cooking or if you're just getting his food.
      <br>
      He'll be there, in his cage staring at you until you give him some food or one of his treats.

    <h3>Things he likes</h3>
    <ul class="list-par">
      <li>Run</li>
      <p>
        As every other hamsters, he likes to run on his wheel and in his ball around the house hitting every piece of
        furniture and ever wall.
        <br>
        Just like a pinball!
      </p>
      <li>Eat</li>
      <p>
        As his owners, Sauron is a pure food lover. He can be picky sometimes but overall if there's food he's happy.
      </p>
      <li>Loves cuddles</li>
      <p>
        When he wakes up with the <em>"right paw"</em> he loves belly rubs and when we delicately scratch his head.</p>
