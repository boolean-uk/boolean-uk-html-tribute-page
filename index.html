    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>Elon Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. He developed an interest in computing while attending Waterkloof House Preparatory School. At age 10, he got his first computer and learned to program. Musk was born to a South African father and a Canadian mother. He displayed an early talent for computers and entrepreneurship. At age 12 he created a video game and sold it to a computer magazine. In 1988, after obtaining a Canadian passport, Musk left South Africa because he was unwilling to support apartheid through compulsory military service and because he sought the greater economic opportunities available in the United States.</p>
