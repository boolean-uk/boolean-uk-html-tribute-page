            <h2>Drawbacks</h2>
            <p>Water doesn't taste like the best thing ever. Plus, everyone who ever drank water ended up dying so it's highly suspicious. Also people say that humanity is running out of water so it might end up being the cause for the next World War and the inevitable destruction of humanity.</p>

            <h2>Noteble fans</h2>
            <p>There are notable fans of water. Here is a poem about water by <em>Samuel Taylor Coleridge</em>, called <strong>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</strong>.</p>
            <p>Day after day, day after day,<br>
                We stuck, nor breath nor motion;<br>
                As idle as a painted ship<br>
                Upon a painted ocean.<br>
                <br>
                Water, water, every where,<br>
                And all the boards did shrink;<br>
                Water, water, every where,<br>
                Nor any drop to drink.<br>
                <br>

                That ever this should be!<br>
                Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs<br>
                Upon the slimy sea.<br>
                <br>
                About, about, in reel and rout<br>
                The death-fires danced at night;<br>
                The water, like a witch’s oils,<br>
                Burnt green, and blue and white…</p>
