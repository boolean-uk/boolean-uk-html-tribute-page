  The Great Pyramid of Giza[a] is the largest Egyptian pyramid and served as the tomb 
  of pharaoh Khufu, who ruled during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom. 
  Built c. 2600 BC,[3] over a period of about 27 years,[4] the pyramid is the oldest 
  of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only wonder that has remained 
  largely intact. It is the most famous monument of the Giza pyramid complex, which 
  is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site "Memphis and its Necropolis".[5] It is 
  situated at the northeastern end of the line of the three main pyramids at Giza.
  <h2> <p> 1. Tallest Man Made Structure for More Than 3800 years </p> </h2>
  Initially standing at 146.6 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the world's 
  tallest human-made structure for more than 3,800 years. Over time, most of the 
  smooth white limestone casing was removed, which lowered the pyramid's height to 
  the current 138.5 metres (454.4 ft); what is seen today is the underlying core 
  structure. The base was measured to be about 230.3 metres (755.6 ft) square, 
  giving a volume of roughly 2.6 million cubic metres (92 million cubic feet), 
  which includes an internal hillock.[6] The dimensions of the pyramid were 280 
  royal cubits (146.7 m; 481.4 ft) high, a base length of 440 cubits (230.6 m; 756.4 ft), 
  with a seked of 5.5 palms (a slope of 51°50'40").
