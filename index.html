        <h2 id="about-zuko">About Zuko</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Zuko might possibly be the best boy on earth. He's a cardigan welsh corgi of 3 years old. He loves playing with his ball, loves going for walks and loves his food. When he's out and about, he gets all the attention. People always stop and point at him, sometimes they even make pictures or stop their car in the middle of the street to say hi! Unfortunately for them he doesn't love strangers. But once he gets to know you he will be all over you and love you forever. He hates being lifted but because of his short legs he needs to be lifted to go up and down the stairs. He will grumble like an old man when this happens. He also often snorts like a piggie. He gets excited very very easily and when he gets excited he gets LOUD. Since he gets excited easily, he gets loud often and he has the loudest bark ever. Which you wouldn't expect from such a small doggie. </p>

        <h2 id="the-breed">The breed</h2>
        <p>You have two different corgi's, who are in fact not the same breed. The two different kinds are: the cardigan welsh corgi and the pembroke welsh corgi. The breeds looks similar but definitely have a few key differences. The pembroke is smaller, often doesn't have a tail and comes in only one color. The cardigan on the other hand is a bit bigger, always has a tail and comes in a great variety of different colors</p>

        <h2 id="the-name">The name</h2>
        <p>The name of course comes from the amazing character Zuko from the legendary show: Avatar the Last Airbender. Just like the character, Zuko has markings that looks like the characters well known scar. The character in the show undergoes one of the best redemption arcs we have ever seen. So we are hoping Zuko will undergo the same thing, taking him from the loud, excitable puppy that he is, to a loveable and sweet dog. Here's to hoping!</p>
