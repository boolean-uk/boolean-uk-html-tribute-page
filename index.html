      <p>
        I saw Pedro Pascal at a grocery store in Los Angeles the other day. I
        told him how surreal it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to
        be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said,
        “Oh, like you're doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was
        “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing
        his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my
        shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay
        for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like
        fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter
        was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to
        pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not
        hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the
        counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple
        times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to
        prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked
        at me. I don't even think that's a word. After she scanned each bar and
        put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her
        by yawning really loudly.
