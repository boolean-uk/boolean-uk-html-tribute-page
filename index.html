    <strong>Thirty Seconds to Mars </strong> (commonly stylized as 30 Seconds to Mars) is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1998. <br>
     The band consists of brothers Jared Leto (lead vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards) and Shannon Leto (drums, percussion). <br> During the course of its existence, it has undergone various line-up changes with the Leto brothers being the only consistent members. <br>

The band's debut album, 30 Seconds to Mars (2002), was produced by Bob Ezrin and released to positive reviews but only to limited commercial success. <br> The band achieved worldwide fame with the release of its second album A Beautiful Lie (2005), which received multiple certifications all over the world.<br> Its next release, This Is War (2009), showed a dramatic evolution in the band's musical style, as it incorporated experimental music as well as eclectic influences.<br> The recording process of the album was marked by a legal dispute with record label EMI that eventually became the subject of the documentary film Artifact (2012). <br> Thirty Seconds to Mars then moved to Universal Music and released the fourth album, Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams (2013), to critical and commercial success. <br> It was followed by America (2018), which polarized critics upon release.
As of September 2014, the band had sold over 15 million albums worldwide.<br>
Thirty Seconds to Mars has consistently enjoyed sold out tours and numerous headlining festival slots. The band is noted for its energetic live performances <br> and for fusing elements from a wide variety of genres, through its use of philosophical and spiritual lyrics, concept albums, and experimental music.<br> Thirty Seconds to Mars has received several awards and accolades throughout its career, including a Guinness World Record, and has been included in the Kerrang!<br>
