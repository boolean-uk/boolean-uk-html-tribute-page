      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>A kid's interest in a sport often gets passed on as a hobby, but Virat's father believed in his son's passion for cricket. So in 1998, Prem Kohli enrolled Virat in the West Delhi Cricket Academy when he was 9 years old.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Kohli first started garnering attention when Rajkumar Sharma invited Ashish Nehra to watch a match the 2002-2003 Polly Umrigar Trophy. Virat Kohli was a part of the Delhi Under-15 team and went on to become the highest run-scorer. He scored 172 runs at an average of 34.40.</li>
        <br>
        <li>By 2006, Kohli was all set to make his debut for Delhi and play his first-ever List A match against Tamil Nadu in the Ranji Trophy. Even though he did not score that well in the match, he did show considerable promise.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Unfortunately, he suffered a personal setback when he lost his father to a heart attack in December 2006 right in the middle of the Ranji Trophy. However, the Indian batsman did let this deter him from his path, instead used it to fuel his performance.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Just a day after his father's demise, Kohli went on to score a 90 against Karnataka in a Ranji match. A match that is noted in history as an inspiration for countless across the nation. It was a testament to how the cricketer did not stray from his goals even in the face of dire personal loss. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Kohli's consistently good performance earned him a spot on the India Under-19 team in 2006, for the England tour.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Virat Kohli played amazingly well in the India Under-19s stint and made his T20 debut in 2007.</li>
