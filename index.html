    <h1>What Are The Top Sites In London?</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      London is one of the most iconic capitals in the world and can be
      considered a truly global city with millions of tourists travelling far
      and wide each year to pay London a visit. London has historically scored
      consistently in the top 5 for the world's most visited cities and this
      seems unlikely to change any time soon. So what makes it such a
      tourist-hotspot?

        place of execution, arsenal, jewel house and zoo! Gaze up at the White
        Tower, tiptoe through a medieval king's bedchamber and marvel at the
        Crown Jewels.

      <p>
        You can't visit London without taking a trip to see the official
        residence of The Queen. Buckingham Palace is open to visitors from July
        to September and you have the opportunity to see the state rooms and
        also the royal gardens. The state rooms are beautifully furnished with
        lavish ornaments and they're still used by the royal family when
        entertaining their guests.
