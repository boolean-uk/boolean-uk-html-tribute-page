          Hello Dad, just to let you know that things have been difficult<br />without
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took some extra courses to making sure that the family has a better
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          My picture below shows that life has been horrible since you left.<br />If
          i only had one wish, i would have wished for you to come back.
        </p>
