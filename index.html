      <p> <i>Mrs Afolake was a devoted christian, mother, sibling and wife. <br>She was a very important part of our lives and we miss her daily. <br>If i had the opportunity to get a wish granted, it would definitely be for her to be alive and healthy.<br>She was a compassionate carer who cared for my grandmother till she took her last breath. <br>She had no daughter , but she took me as hers. <br>She was my mom's confidant and best friend. <br>My mom talks about her daily. <br>She was the strongest person i know. <br>She raised four sons alone and they all turned out well. <br>Very sad that we lost her but we believe someday we will all re-unite in the Lord.
