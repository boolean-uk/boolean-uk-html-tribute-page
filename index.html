    <h1>A tribute to Camels</h1>

    <h3>Why are camels amazing?</h3>
    <p>Camels are unique in their versatility, for they can not only be eaten, riden, and ridiculed, but they are also permanently incognito as a relatively popular brand of cigarette throughout most of Europe. A truly unique disguise unheard of throughout the rest of the animal kingdom.</p>

    <h3 class="othertitles">Why should you get a camel? Or should you?</h3>
    <p> This is a contentious topic, as some people do not enjoy the spit that can emmanate from a camel when it is infact grouchy, however it's important to remember that irritation is a natural thing to suffer from, something this author is also inherently guilty of. 
        One thing worth considering if you are not a smoker, and you do not enjoy that incognito aspect of the animal, is whether or not you would benefit from using a camel to cross a desert? Some say they can be more useful than horses, something I would tend to agree with. 
        In essence, buy a camel if you want one, i'm a big fan. However if you don't, that's fine too.
