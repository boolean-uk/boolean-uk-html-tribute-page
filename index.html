        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Hello readers,
          <br/>
          so I'd like to start by saying. My name is Kyle, 
          I am 27 years old and this is a goFundMe for my upcoming Amsterdam trip.
          <br/> 
          Unfortunately, of very recent I have come down with a serious disease. 
          The disease I have inherited is Poverty, 
          I am poor and I can't actually afford my holiday. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Below, here is a current photo of me and my current state:
