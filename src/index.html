            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Samarkand</strong> or <strong>Samarqand</strong> is a city
              in southeastern Uzbekistan and among the oldest continuously
              inhabited cities in Central Asia. Samarkand is the capital of
              Samarqand Region and a district-level city, that includes the
              urban-type settlements Kimyogarlar, Farxod and Xishrav.[2] With
              551,700 inhabitants (2021),[3] it is the second-largest city of
              Uzbekistan.[citation needed] Most of the inhabitants of the city
              are native speakers of the Tajik dialect of the Persian language

            <h3>Early History</h3>
            <p>
              There is evidence of human activity in the area of the city dating
              from the late Paleolithic Era. Though there is no direct evidence
              of when Samarkand was founded, several theories propose that it
              was founded between the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. Prospering from
              its location on the Silk Road between China, Persia and Europe, at
              times Samarkand was one of the largest[6] cities in Central
              Asia,[7] and was an important city of the empires of Greater
              Iran.[8] By the time of the Persian Achaemenid Empire, it was the
              capital of the Sogdian satrapy. The city was conquered by
              Alexander the Great in 329 BCE, when it was known as Markanda,
              which was rendered in Greek as Μαράκανδα.[9] The city was ruled by
              a succession of Iranian and Turkic rulers until it was conquered
              by the Mongols under Genghis Khan in 1220.

            <h3>Hellenistic period</h3>
            <p>
              The city is noted as a centre of Islamic scholarly study and the
              birthplace of the Timurid Renaissance. In the 14th century, Timur
              (Tamerlane) made it the capital of his empire and the site of his
              mausoleum, the Gur-e Amir. The Bibi-Khanym Mosque, rebuilt during
              the Soviet era, remains one of the city's most notable landmarks.
              Samarkand's Registan square was the city's ancient centre and is
              bounded by three monumental religious buildings. The city has
              carefully preserved the traditions of ancient crafts: embroidery,
              goldwork, silk weaving, copper engraving, ceramics, wood carving,
              and wood painting.[10] In 2001, UNESCO added the city to its World
              Heritage List as Samarkand – Crossroads of Cultures.

            <p>
              Modern Samarkand is divided into two parts: the old city, and the
              new city, which was developed during the days of the Russian
              Empire and Soviet Union. The old city includes historical
              monuments, shops, and old private houses; the new city includes
              administrative buildings along with cultural centres and
              educational institutions.[11] On September 15–16, 2022, the city
              hosted the 2022 SCO summit.
