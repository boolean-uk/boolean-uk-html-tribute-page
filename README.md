<!-- 09-19-2023 In the profile page you created yesterday:
1) Add padding, margin and borders to some of the elements on your page
2a) Create a new <div> which is a "block" with a background colour of your choice and a height of 200px
2b) Inside that <div>, add 3 divs that are "inline-blocks", each with a different background colour, and each being 100px x 100px (width x height)
3a) In between these inline-block <divs>, add a <span> element with the text "Hello!" in it (So the order of your elements should be: div span div span div)
3b) Apply some styles to these <span> elements -->
